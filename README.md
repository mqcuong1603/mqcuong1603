### Hi there, I'm Cuong ðŸ‘‹

I'm a final-year student at Ton Duc Thang University, on the path to becoming a professional Software Engineer. I'm passionate about building robust, scalable, and elegant backend systems.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring diverse topics through booksâ€”from history and philosophy to fiction like *To Kill a Mockingbird* and *Sophie's World*.
