### Project Spotlight

**[e-commerce-soa](https://github.com/mqcuong1603/e-commerce-soa) â€” A Resilient E-Commerce Platform**

This project is an implementation of an e-commerce backend using a **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**. The goal was to design a system where core functionalities (like user management, product catalog, and orders) are developed as independent, loosely-coupled services. This approach enhances scalability, and maintainability, and allows for independent deployment of components.
